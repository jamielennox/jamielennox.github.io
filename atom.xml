    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the Havana release of OpenStack, Keystone gains the ability to issue and verify tokens &ldquo;bound&rdquo; to some authentication mechanism.
To understand the reason for this feature we need to first consider the security model of the current token architecture.</p>

<p>OpenStack tokens are what we call &ldquo;bearer tokens&rdquo;.
The term seems to have come out of the OAuth movement but means that whoever has the token has all the rights associated with that person.
This is not an uncommon situation on the Internet, it is the way basic auth (username and password), cookies, and session ids all work, and one of the reasons that SSL is so important when authenticating against a website.
If an attacker was to get your token then they have all the rights of that token for as long as it is valid, including permission to reissue a token or change your password.
While all of these mechanism are symmetric secrets, they are only shared between two end points.
Keystone tokens are shared across all of the public services in an OpensStack deployment.</p>

<p>As OpenStack grows and this token is presented to an ever increasing list of services the vulnerability of this mechanism increases.
So what can we do about it?
The typical answer, particularly for the enterprise, is to use Kerberos or x509 client certificates.
This is a great solution but we don&rsquo;t want to have each service dealing with different authentication mechanisms, that&rsquo;s what Keystone does.</p>

<h2>What is a &ldquo;bound token&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;bound token&rdquo; is a regular keystone token with some additional information that indicates that the token may only be used in conjunction with the specified external authentication mechanism.
Taking the example of Kerberos, when a token is issued Keystone embeds the name of the Kerberos principle into the token.
When this token is then presented to another service the service notices the bind information and ensures that Kerberos authentication was used and that the same user is making the request.</p>

<p>So how does this help to protect token hijacking?
To give an example:</p>

<ol>
<li> Alice connects to Keystone using her Kerberos credentials and gets a token.
 Embedded within this token is her Kerberos principal name <code>alice@ACME.COM</code>.</li>
<li> Alice authenticates to HaaS (hacked as a service) using her token and Kerberos credentials and is allowed to perform her operations.</li>
<li> Bob, who has privileged access to HaaS, records the token that Alice presented to the service (or otherwise gets Alice&rsquo;s token)</li>
<li> Bob attempts to connect to Keystone as Alice to change her password.
 He connects to keystone with his own Kerberos credentials <code>bob@ACME.COM</code>.
 Because these credentials do not match the ones that were present when the token was created his access is disallowed.</li>
</ol>


<p>It does not necessarily mean that the user initially authenticated themselves by there Kerberos credentials, they may have used there regular username and password.
It simply means that the user who created the token has said that they are also the owner of this Kerberos principal (note: that it is tied to the principal, not a ticket so it will survive ticket re-issuing) and the token should not be authenticated in future without it present.</p>

<h2>What is implemented?</h2>

<p>Currently tokens issued from Keystone can be bound to a Kerberos principal.
Extending this mechanism to x509 client certificates should be a fairly simple exercise but will not be included in the Havana release.</p>

<p>A patch to handle bind checking in auth_token middleware is currently under review to bring checking to other services.</p>

<p>There are however a number of problems with enforcing bound tokens today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kerberos authentication is not supported by the eventlet http server (the server that drives most of the OpenStack web services), and so there is no way to authenticate to the server to provide the credentials.
This essentially restricts bind checking to services running in httpd, which to the best of my knowledge is currently only keystone and swift.</li>
<li>None of the clients currently support connecting with Kerberos authentication.
The option was added to Keystoneclient as a proof of concept but I am hoping that this can be solved across all clients by standardizing the way they communicate rather than having to add and maintain support in each individual client.
There will also be the issue of how to configure the servers to use these clients correctly.</li>
<li>Kerberos tickets are issued to users, not hosts, and typically expire after a period of time.
To allow unattended servers to have valid Kerberos credentials requires a way of automatically refreshing or fetching new tickets.
I am told that there is support for this scenario coming in Fedora 20 but I am not sure what it will involve.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Configuring Token Binding</h2>

<p>The new argument to enable token binding in <code>keystone.conf</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>[token]

# External auth mechanisms that should add bind information to token.
# eg kerberos, x509
bind = kerberos
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned currently only the value Kerberos is currently supported here.
One of the next supported mechanisms will be x509 client certificates.</p>

<p>To enable token bind authentication in <code>keystone.conf</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>[token]
# Enforcement policy on tokens presented to keystone with bind information.
# One of disabled, permissive, strict, required or a specifically required bind
# mode e.g. kerberos or x509 to require binding to that authentication.
enforce_token_bind = permissive
</code></pre>

<p>As illustrated by the comments the possible values here are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>disabled</code>: Disables token bind checking.</li>
<li><code>permissive</code>: Token bind information will be verified if present.
 If there is bind information for a token and the server does not know how to verify that information then it will be ignored and the token will be allowed.
 This is the new default value and should have no effect on existing systems.</li>
<li><code>strict</code>: Like permissive but if unknown bind information is present then the token will be rejected.</li>
<li><code>required</code>: Tokens will only be allowed if bind information is present and verified.</li>
<li>A specific form of bind information is present and verified.
The only currently available value here is <code>kerberos</code> indicating that a token must be bound to a Kerberos principal to be accepted.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>For a deployment with access to a Kerberos or x509 infrastructure token binding will dramatically increase your user&rsquo;s security.
Unfortunately the limitations of Kerberos within OpenStack don&rsquo;t really make this a viable deployment option in Havana.
Watch this space however as we add x509 authentication and binding, and improve Kerberos handling throughout.</p>

    <link href="http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2013/09/30/keystone-with-httpd-in-devstack/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-30T13:53:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2013/09/30/keystone-with-httpd-in-devstack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Keystone has been slowly pushing away from being deployed with <a href="http://eventlet.net">Eventlet</a> and the <code>keystone-all</code> script in favour of the more traditional httpd mod_wsgi application method.
There has been discussion of Eventlet&rsquo;s place in OpenStack <a href="http://davidhadas.wordpress.com/2012/05/14/asynchronousio/">before</a> and its (mis)use has led to numerous subtle bugs and problems, however from my opinion in Keystone the most important reasons to move away from Eventlet are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eventlet does not support Kerberos authentication.</li>
<li>pyOpenSSL only releases the GIL around some SSL verification commands.
This leads to a series of hacks to prevent long running crypto commands blocking Eventlet threads and thus the entire Keystone process.</li>
<li>There are already a lot of httpd authentication/authorization plugins that we could make use of in Keystone.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s faster to have things handled by httpd modules in C than in Python.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keystone has shipped with sample WSGI scripts and httpd configuration files since Foslom and documentation for how to use them <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/apache-httpd.html">is available</a> however most guides and service wrappers (upstart, systemd etc) will use the <code>keystone-all</code> method.</p>

<p>To get some wider adoption and understanding of the process I&rsquo;ve just added Keystone with httpd support into devstack.
Simply set:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>APACHE_ENABLED_SERVICES=key</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in your localrc or environment variables and re-run <code>./stack.sh</code> to try it out.</p>

<p>P.S. Swift can also be deployed this way by adding <code>swift</code> to the (comma separated) services list.</p>

    <link href="http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2013/09/27/apiclient-communications/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-27T15:27:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2013/09/27/apiclient-communications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been interest recently in porting novaclient&rsquo;s authentication plugin system to the rest of the OpenStack client libraries and moving the plugins into keystoneclient.
At a similar time <a href="http://aababilov.wordpress.com">Alessio Ababilov</a> started trying to introduce the concept of a <a href="http://openstackgd.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/preconditions-for-common-openstack-client-library/">common base client</a> into keystoneclient.
This is a fantastic idea and one that is well supported by the Keystone, Oslo and I&rsquo;m sure other teams.
I&rsquo;ve been referring to this move as APIClient as that is the name of the folder in Oslo code.
At its core is a change in how clients communicate that will result in some significant changes to the base client objects and incorporate these plugins.</p>

<p>Keystone is interested in handling how communication is managed within OpenStack, not just for tokens but as we bring in client certificate and kerberos authentication it will need to have influence over the requests being sent.
After discussing the situation with Alessio he agreed to let me take his base work and start the process of getting these changes into keystoneclient with the intent that this pattern be picked up by other OpenStack clients.
This has unfortunately been a slower process than I would have liked and I think it is hampered by a lack of clear understanding in what is trying to be achieved, which I hope to address with this post.
What follows is in the vein of Alessio&rsquo;s ideas and definitely a result of his work but is my own interpretation of the problem and the implementation has been rewritten from that initial work.</p>

<p>Most OpenStack clients have the concept of a HTTPClient which abstracts the basic communication with a server, however projects differ in what this object is and how it is used.
Novaclient creates an instance of a HTTPClient object which it saves as <code>self.client</code> (for yet another candidate for what a client object is).
Much of what the novaclient object does then in terms of setting and using authentication plugins is simply a wrapper around calls to the HTTPClient object.
Managers (the part of client responsible for a resource eg user, project etc) are provided with a reference to the base client object (this time saved as <code>api</code>) and so make requests in the form <code>self.api.client.get</code>.
Keystoneclient subclasses HTTPClient and managers make calls in the form <code>self.api.get</code>.
Other projects can go either way depending on which client they were using as reference.</p>

<p>My <em>guess</em> here is that when keystoneclient was initially split out from novaclient the subclassing of HTTPClient was intentional, such that keystoneclient would provide an authenticated HTTPClient that novaclient would use.
Keystoneclient however has its own managers and requirements and the projects have sufficiently diverged so that it no longer fits into this role.
To this day novaclient does not use keystoneclient (in any way) and introduced authentication plugins instead.</p>

<p>If there is going to be a common communication framework then there must be a decision between:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standardizing on a common base client class that is capable of handling communication (as keystoneclient does).</li>
<li>Create a standalone communication object that clients make use of (as novaclient does).</li>
</ul>


<p>The APIClient design goes for the latter.
We create a communication object that can be used by any type of client <em>and</em> be reused by different instances of clients (which novaclient does not currently allow).
This communication object is passed between clients deprecating some of the ever increasing list of parameters passed to clients and changes the flow from authenticating a client to authenticating a channel that clients can make use of.
This centralizes authentication and token fetching (including kerberos and client certs), catalog management and endpoint selection and will let us address caching, HTTP session management etc in the future.</p>

<p>In the initial APIClient this object was the new HTTPClient, however this term was so abused I am currently using ClientSession (as it is built on the requests library and is similar to the requests.Session concept) but debate continues.</p>

<p>This is where authentication plugins will live so that any communication through a ClientSession object can request a token added from the plugin.
Maintaining the plugin architecture is preferred here to simply having multiple ClientSession subclasses to allow independent storing and caching of authentication, plugin discovery, and changing or renewing authentication.</p>

<p>So an example of the new workflow is:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It is obviously a little longer than the current method but I&rsquo;m sure that the old syntax can be maintained for when you only need a single client.</p>

<p>Implementations of this are starting to go into review on keystoneclient.
For the time being some features from nova such as authentication plugins specifying CLI arguments are not being considered until we can ensure that the new system meets at least the current functionality.</p>

<p>The major problem found so far is maintaining API compatibility.
Much of what is currently on keystoneclient that will be moved is defined publicly and cannot simply be thrown away even though they are typically attributes and abstract functions that a user should have no need of.</p>

<p>Hopefully this or something very similar will be coming to the various OpenStack clients soon.</p>

    <link href="http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2012/11/11/cryptographic-message-syntax/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-11T17:13:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2012/11/11/cryptographic-message-syntax</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CMS is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF">IETF</a>&rsquo;s standardized approach to cryptographically secure messages.
It provides a BER encoded, ASN1 defined means of communicating the parameters and data of a message between recipients.</p>

<p>The most recent definitions come from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> and it does do a good job of explaining how each operation works and what is required, it even provides some usage examples.
What is missing is a simple rundown of the different types of messages that goes into more detail than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_Message_Syntax">Wikipedia</a> but doesn&rsquo;t have you jumping straight into the RFC.</p>

<p>Data section should be thought of as a way of using a cryptographic function rather than a message all on its own.
Correlations will become obvious but EncryptedData is simply a way of portraying symmetrically encrypted data and AuthenticatedData is essentially a way of addressing and sending a MAC.
As with using normal crypto functions you will often need a combination to provide the required security and so CMS messages are designed to contain nested data sections.
A common example is a Signed data wrapping an Enveloped data to provide confidentiality and authenticity, or an Enveloped Digest message for confidentiality and integrity.</p>

<p>I realize this is by no means a comprehensive rundown but it should frame the situation and give an overview before you get to the RFC.
The meat of the post is a list of each CMS data type and the most important parts of the ASN1 definition as it should allow you to figure out how each segment is used and the chain of data you will want in your message.</p>

<h3>EncryptedData</h3>

<p>The most simple CMS message just takes a symmetric key and encrypt some data.
How to give that key to someone else is outside this message.
It&rsquo;s defined as:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>EncryptedData ::= SEQUENCE {
</span><span class='line'>  version CMSVersion,
</span><span class='line'>  encryptedContentInfo EncryptedContentInfo,
</span><span class='line'>  unprotectedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnprotectedAttributes OPTIONAL }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>DigestedData</h3>

<p>Provides a digest along with the plaintext.
Typically this is then wrapped by an EnvelopedData or such to provide Integrity to a message.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>DigestedData ::= SEQUENCE {

</span><span class='line'>  digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
</span><span class='line'>  encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
</span><span class='line'>  digest Digest }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>SignedData</h3>

<p>SignedData messages allow any number of certificates to sign a payload.
In the regular signing way, each signer creates a digest of the payload and encrypts it with their private key.
The message contains the certificate of the signers and can contain a store of certificates and CRLs for cert path validation by the receiver.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  crls [1] IMPLICIT RevocationInfoChoices OPTIONAL,
</span><span class='line'>  signerInfos SignerInfos }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>EnvelopedData</h3>

<p>EnvelopedData allows you to address encrypted data to any number of specific recipients.
The most common recipients are a certificate (or the private key of), a symmetric key or a password.
The payload is encrypted with a symmetric key and then this key is encrypted with the key provided by the recipient (or PBKDF for passwords).
So on decoding the recipient will decrypt the symmetric key from the RecipientInfo associated with them and then use that to decrypt the plaintext mesage.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  pwri [3] PasswordRecipientinfo,
</span><span class='line'>  ori [4] OtherRecipientInfo }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>AuthenticatedData</h3>

<p>AuthenticatedData is the one that always trips me up, it allows you to send a message that is only verifiable by a number of specific recipients.
It generates a new MAC secret key and with it generates a MAC digest for the plaintext.
It then encrypts the MAC secret key to any number of recipients similar to EnvelopedData and includes the MAC in the message.
The message itself is not encrypted and can be retrieved, but you cannot assert the message integrity without being one of the explicit recipients.</p>
