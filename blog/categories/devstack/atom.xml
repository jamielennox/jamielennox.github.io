    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Keystone has been slowly pushing away from being deployed with <a href="http://eventlet.net">Eventlet</a> and the <code>keystone-all</code> script in favour of the more traditional httpd mod_wsgi application method.
There has been discussion of Eventlet&rsquo;s place in OpenStack <a href="http://davidhadas.wordpress.com/2012/05/14/asynchronousio/">before</a> and its (mis)use has led to numerous subtle bugs and problems, however from my opinion in Keystone the most important reasons to move away from Eventlet are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eventlet does not support Kerberos authentication.</li>
<li>pyOpenSSL only releases the GIL around some SSL verification commands.
This leads to a series of hacks to prevent long running crypto commands blocking Eventlet threads and thus the entire Keystone process.</li>
<li>There are already a lot of httpd authentication/authorization plugins that we could make use of in Keystone.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s faster to have things handled by httpd modules in C than in Python.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keystone has shipped with sample WSGI scripts and httpd configuration files since Foslom and documentation for how to use them <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/apache-httpd.html">is available</a> however most guides and service wrappers (upstart, systemd etc) will use the <code>keystone-all</code> method.</p>

<p>To get some wider adoption and understanding of the process I&rsquo;ve just added Keystone with httpd support into devstack.
Simply set:
<code>
APACHE_ENABLED_SERVICES=key
</code>
in your localrc or environment variables and re-run <code>./stack.sh</code> to try it out.</p>

<p>P.S. Swift can also be deployed this way by adding <code>swift</code> to the (comma separated) services list.</p>
